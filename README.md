# 🧠 My Go Learning Journey — Advent of Code 2024

Welcome! 👋  
This repo is where I’m **learning and mastering Go** by solving **Advent of Code 2024** problems —  
not to chase stars or rankings, but to **understand Go deeply** through real problem-solving.

---

### 🎯 Why I’m Doing This

- To get comfortable with Go’s syntax, logic, and style
- To practice clean, readable code — no shortcuts
- To enjoy learning by solving small, well-structured problems

---

## 🏷️ Notes

This project isn’t about completing Advent of Code —
it’s about **deeply learning Go by solving structured problems**.
